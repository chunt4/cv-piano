# cv-piano

Download our most recent google colab codes.

Towards the bottom of our code there is a segment which begins with:
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('/content/drive/My Drive/Computer Vision Semester Project/dan.mp4')

Please use this segement to run our code and adjust the path leading to dan.mp4 as needed.
Running this segment will point you to run other segments as their functions will need to be run and defined before working in the main segment.

Also please mount your own google drive at the top of the Colab. 

If you have any other questions please reach out to Chris or Dan.

Thank you.
